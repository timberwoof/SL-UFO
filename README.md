GRAB and RELEASE
===========
When you find some people hover over them,
Click the UFO and select STOP. 
Click the UFO and select Scan. 
The UFO will make a cool noise and emit a fun scanning beam. 

When it's done, it will tell you the number of avatars with RLV relays it has sensed. 
Click the UFO and select GRAB. 
Select someone to Grab. 
Watch them wriggle as the UFO uses antigravity to pick them up and sit them down inside. 
Continue doing that until you have four people. 

Click the UFO and select Close Cupola. 
Click the UFO and select Manual. 
Fly around to some other place and hover. 

Click the UFO and select STOP. 
Click the UFO and select Release. 
Select someone to release. 
If you are at 100 meters altitude or less, the UFO will drop your victim just above the ground. 
If you are higher than that, it will drop them just below the UFO. 

You can fly around some more or release them all now. 

You can release people in any order; the UFO will know which empty seats to put new victims in. 

PARKING
=====
When you've harassed enough groundlings, please return the UFO to its hangar. 
Fly to about <50, 110, 1305> and face East. 
You will see the space station and Hangar 01. 
Set your view to Pilot. 
Reduce power and fly forward. You will see some circle-checker things: a big one in the middle and two smaller ones to each side. Once you're within the hangar, reduce power to 2%. Fly forward, keeping the inner and outer checkerball lined up. Watch the two smaller side balls. When you're lose, reduce power to 1%. When all three are lined up, you're lined up in X and Y. Now move up slowly. You will see another checkerball above the railing. Rise until that lines up. in the Power menu, select Stop.
