When it's done, it will tell you the number of avatars it has sensed. 
(It does not tell you who has RLV.)
Click the UFO and select GRAB.

Watch them wriggle as the UFO uses antigravity to pick them up and sit them down inside. 
Continue doing that until you have four people. 

Click the UFO and select Close Cupola.

Fly around to some other place and hover. 

Click the UFO and select STOP.

You can fly around some more or release them all now. 

You can release people in any order; the UFO will know which empty seats to put new victims in.
